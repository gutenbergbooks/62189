<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s cultural heritage dates back to approximately 10,000 B.C.
when man first entered this region. Since that time, many other Indian
groups have settled here. Each of these groups has left evidence of its
presence in the archaeological record. The Anthropological Study series
published by the Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism provides
a readable account of various activities of these cultural groups.</p>
<p>Robert W. Neuman, Curator of Anthropology at the Museum of
Geoscience, Louisiana State University, and Nancy W. Hawkins, outreach
coordinator for the State Division of Archaeology, coauthored this
volume. It is the result of the realization that relatively few Louisiana
residents are aware of the state&rsquo;s rich archaeological heritage. Furthermore,
there is little introductory information available to them about Louisiana&rsquo;s
past. <i>Louisiana Prehistory</i> was written to meet this need. It is a
short summary of the state&rsquo;s prehistory and is meant to be a person&rsquo;s first
exposure to the state&rsquo;s prehistoric archaeology. For this reason theoretical
and technical discussions are kept at a minimum.</p>
<p><b>Louisiana Prehistory</b> tells the story of man&rsquo;s occupation of the state
during its first 11,600 years. It begins with the big game hunters of 10,000
B.C. and describes the changing life styles brought about by the end of the
Ice Age. It relates the influences of various people moving into and out of
Louisiana and their effects on Louisiana cultures. Finally it recounts the
development of mound building which culminated in the large ceremonial
centers described by the early European explorers.</p>
<p>I trust that the reader will enjoy this introduction to Louisiana&rsquo;s
prehistoric Indian heritage.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, when the world was in the midst of
the Ice Age, the first humans made their way into North America. At that
time, thick sheets of ice covering the polar regions had tied up so much of
the earth&rsquo;s water that the oceans were approximately 400 feet lower than
they are today. All around the world sections of land that are now underwater
were then above sea level. An extensive land bridge connected
Siberia to Alaska across what is now the Bering Strait and people from
Asia used this route for their passage into North America.</p>
<p>The land bridge between the two continents was clear of ice for
thousands of years, and vegetation from both sides intermixed. Grazing
animals, and the people who hunted them, gradually wandered from Asia
into North America, probably without ever realizing they were moving
into a new region. Although the earliest immigrants may have reached
North America over 40,000 years ago, most of the present evidence dates
from between 23,000 and 8,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Much of Canada was covered with ice during this time, but periodically,
ice-free corridors of land connected Alaska with the Great Plains of
the United States. Over hundreds of generations nomadic people spread
throughout southern North America, Central America, and South
America. At least by 12,000 years ago, the first Indians lived in the southeastern
United States. The prehistoric era in Louisiana begins with these
first inhabitants and concludes with the arrival of the Europeans. The
chart at the left outlines the long, rich prehistory of Louisiana.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">PALEO-INDIAN</span></h2>
<p>Twelve thousand years ago, the average temperature in the southeastern
United States was five to 10 degrees cooler than it is now, and the
climate was drier. The landscape was covered with oak and pine forests
mixed with open grasslands. Some familiar animals such as rabbits and
deer lived in the area, but many other animals that have become extinct in
North America, were also common then. Included were the camel, giant
armadillo, short-faced bear, long-horned bison, mastodon, tapir, ground
sloth, saber-toothed tiger, mammoth, dire wolf, and horse (the horse was
later reintroduced by the Spanish).</p>
<p>The earliest Indians in Louisiana, called
Paleo-Indians, hunted these animals with spears
tipped with stone points. The points were two to six
inches long, and lanceolate, with bases that were
either straight or rounded inward. The Paleo-Indians
in Louisiana made their points from carefully
selected varieties of stones that appear to have
come from neighboring regions in Texas and Arkansas.</p>
<p>The first step in making a point was to strike a
selected stone from a strategic angle with another
stone, detaching a relatively large, flat, oval piece
called a flake. The second step was to shape the
large flake by chipping off smaller flakes with a
rock, bone fragment, or antler tip. The final steps
were to remove the delicate finishing flakes by
firmly pressing against the edge of the point with an
antler or bone tool, and then to grind the base of the
point smooth with a stone. The point then was fastened
directly to a wooden shaft with hide, fiber or
an adhesive substance, or it was attached to a bone
section that was connected to the spear shaft.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap">(actual size)</p>
</div>
<p>To pierce the skin of one of the large animals, such as a mastodon or
mammoth, the hunters had to be close to the powerful beast. They hurled
or jabbed their spears at the animal, and tried to confuse and immobilize
their prey. Perhaps several hunters surrounded an isolated animal waving
their arms and distracting it while one or two others speared it. If the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
animal was wounded, the hunters would have tracked it until it became
very weak or went to water to drink. Even a mastodon, wounded and
exhausted, or mired in the mud of a shallow lake, would have been relatively
easy game for a small group of experienced hunters.</p>
<p>Men and older boys almost certainly were the hunters for the Paleo-Indian
groups. Women and children collected fruits, seeds, roots, and
other plant foods to supplement their diet.</p>
<p>Paleo-Indians lived in small nomadic groups that remained in one area
only as long as the animals and plant foods were plentiful. The evidence
indicates that they camped near streams in temporary shelters made of
branches, grass and hides. At other times, they preferred high ground
where they could see the countryside to watch for animals. The camp may
have had a central area for group activities surrounded by living areas
where families cooked and slept. These people probably used animal skins
for clothing and as blankets, and may have had dogs as pets. They did not
raise other animals or grow crops. They used no metal and made no
pottery.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Louisiana Paleo-Indian sites (areas where remains are found) are not
common, because the small groups of nomadic Indians left very few artifacts
at any location. High rainfall and humidity then led to decay and
erosion of many ancient sites while changing geography led to the disappearance
of others. The sea level has risen, so any Paleo-Indian coastal
remains are now on the ocean floor. Sites once along the Mississippi River
have been washed away or deeply buried as the river shifted its course
and deposited silt. Most Paleo-Indian spear points found in Louisiana have
been collected from ridges, hills and salt domes. Generally, these areas
have not been affected by stream changes and sea level fluctuations that
have occurred since the Ice Age.</p>
<p>As the Ice Age drew to a close, Louisiana began to change. The
climate gradually became warmer and wetter and many large Ice Age
animals became extinct. The way of life of the Paleo-Indians began to
change, too. They started hunting smaller game and collecting and eating
more plant foods.</p>
<p>The late Paleo-Indians fashioned a variety of stone tools that could be
used for butchering game, preparing hides, and working bone and wood.
They also manufactured many kinds of stone points that were generally
smaller than the earlier points. These late Paleo-Indian tools were made
from Louisiana stone, a change from the earlier time.</p>
<p>Sites of the late Paleo-Indian period are more numerous than early
Paleo-Indian sites. This suggests that the population increased and that
these people camped longer in one place. Their sites are characterized by
more artifacts, and more varieties of artifacts, than earlier Paleo-Indian
sites.</p>

<p>Both early and late Paleo-Indian

At the lowest (oldest) level, two early
Paleo-Indian stone points were uncovered.
A wide variety of later materials were excavated
from higher levels. The site was
used by small groups of people who camped
there temporarily. The groups used the site
as a base camp for hunting, butchering, and
hideworking activities.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">MESO-INDIAN</span></h2>
<p>The gradual transition from the late Paleo-Indian to the early Meso-Indian
Period had occurred by 5000 B.C. Meso-Indians, also called Archaic
Indians, lived in small nomadic groups. Unlike their predecessors,
however, they remained longer in each camp location and exploited smaller
geographical areas. Whereas a Paleo-Indian might roam from Texas to
Mississippi in his lifetime, returning rarely to the same place, a Meso-Indian
might spend his whole life in a six-parish area, returning each
season to favored campsites.</p>
<p>The seasonal movements of the Meso-Indians were determined by the
best times to hunt and gather certain foods. Clams, fish and deer were
available year-round, so Meso-Indians often stayed near streams, where
these were plentiful. This strategy was especially critical in the winter
months when plant foods were least available. The Indians camped where
they could collect tender, young plants in the spring; fruits in the summer;
and pecans and walnuts in the fall. Meso-Indians had a varied diet, eating
seeds, roots, nuts, fruits, fish, clams, reptiles, game birds and mammals.</p>
<p>As Meso-Indian family groups traveled, they met other hunting
groups, and sometimes camped together. These were important times for
social and ceremonial activities. They probably smoked pipes together and
shared information about good hunting, fishing, and plant collecting areas.
They exchanged gifts of tools, food, stone, and shell. Sometimes these
large groups camped together for a season or more, near rivers or near the
coast where dependable food resources could support many families.</p>

<p class="pcap">Banana Bayou Site</p>
</div>
<p>The Banana Bayou Site, located on the
Avery Island salt dome in Iberia Parish,
consists of a low, man-made earthen
mound, 80 feet in diameter. Charcoal from
the mound gives the radiocarbon date of
2490 &plusmn; 260 years B.C. Nut shells and fish,
deer and turtle bones have been found in
the mound as well as two stone points that
are characteristic of the Meso-Indian
Period. These findings lead archaeologists
to conclude that the site is one of the earliest
mounds in the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Dogs may have been kept as pets, and may have helped in hunting.
Meso-Indians developed many new hunting and fishing techniques. They
used fishhooks, traps, and nets for catching fish and other small animals,
and they used a new weapon called the atlatl (pronounced at&prime;lat&prime;l) to help
kill their most important prey, deer.</p>
<p>An atlatl was made from a flattish, two-foot long piece of wood and
was used as a spear-thrower. It had a hook, made of bone or antler,
attached on one end and a hand grip carved on the other end. A stone,
clay, or shell weight was sometimes attached toward the hooked end to
increase the force of the throw, or perhaps only for decoration. A spear
was rested on the atlatl with the end of the spear shaft inserted into the
atlatl hook. The hunter held the atlatl grip and the middle of the spear in
the same hand, then he hurled the spear from the atlatl (see cover illustration).
The atlatl acted as an extension of his arm, giving extra power and
accuracy to the throw.</p>
<p>The Meso-Indian spears used with the atlatl differed from those used
by Paleo-Indians. They were shorter, and the stone points were different.
Meso-Indian spear points were chipped from local stone, and they were
slightly larger and not as artistically made as late Paleo-Indian points.
Beyond these general trends, however, many Meso-Indian points found in
Louisiana have little in common with each other. The sides of some are
curved, others are straight, and some are serrated. Some are wider at the
base, some are narrower, and others have notches in the base. The variations
in shape seem almost unlimited.</p>

<p class="pcap">(&frac34; actual size)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>In contrast to the changes in styles of points, Meso-Indians continued
making their stone butchering and hideworking tools in much the same
way as the Paleo-Indians. Meso-Indians also fabricated non-stone tools
and ornaments. They made bone needles, awls, fishhooks, beads, and
hairpins; and antler atlatl hooks, handles, and spear points. Less common
objects were tortoise shell rattles and shell ornaments.</p>
<p>Meso-Indians developed new tools as they increased their knowledge
of plant resources. They made baskets to carry and store seeds, roots,
fruits and nuts. They cracked nuts with specially shaped stones, and
ground nuts and seeds into flour with grinding stones.</p>

<p class="pcap">Meso-Indian: Grinding Stones
(&frac12; actual size)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The Meso-Indians also made axes and
chopping tools for cutting down trees and
hollowing out tree trunks. Like the atlatl
weights, grinding stones, pipes, and stone
ornaments, some of these axes were made
using a new technique. Instead of being
flaked, these stone tools were roughly
pecked into desired shapes with a hard
hammerstone, then ground smooth with
sandstone or sand and water. When completed,
some of these ground stone tools
had a highly polished surface.</p>

<p class="pcap">(&frac12; actual size)</p>
</div>
<p>Although the methods of hunting, gathering plants, and making tools
remained relatively unchanged throughout the Meso-Indian Period, some
things were changing. Gradually the population expanded. Groups began
to move less frequently, and to travel over smaller areas. They learned
more about their environment as they began living, from one season to
another, in the same general area. Apparently some Louisiana Meso-Indians
remained in one place long enough to build earthen mounds. If the
dates for these mounds are correct, then they are the earliest known
mounds in the United States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">NEO-INDIAN</span></h2>
<p>During the Neo-Indian Period the population expanded and some
groups became sedentary, staying in one place for several years or more.
Most Meso-Indian tools continued to be used by Neo-Indians, but added to
these were stone and pottery vessels, baked clay balls, and many decorative
or ceremonial objects. Also, for the first time, shell and earthen
mounds were regularly built.</p>
<p>The Neo-Indian Period lasted from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 1600 and included
the following cultures: Poverty Point, Tchefuncte, Marksville,
Troyville-Coles Creek, Caddo and Plaquemine-Mississippian. These
groups differed from one another in when and where they lived, as well as
in the objects and earthworks they made.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Poverty Point</h3>
<p>The Poverty Point Culture flourished from approximately 2000 B.C.
to 700 B.C. The culture is named for the famous Poverty Point Site where
the largest earthworks of the period were built. During this time, Poverty
Point people lived in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas, and they
usually settled near major rivers, junctions of lakes and rivers, or in
coastal marshes. These locations supported a wide variety of plants and
animals that could be used for food.</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" />
<p class="pcap">Poverty Point Site</p>
</div>
<p>The Poverty Point Site is near Epps,
Louisiana, in the northeastern corner of the
state. The site is now a State Commemorative
Area that can be visited by the public.
It covers more than a square mile, and
when the ridges and mounds were built
they were the largest earthworks in the
Western Hemisphere. Although the exact
function of the ridges is as yet unknown, it
is speculated that the aisles may have been
used in astronomical observations because
two of them line up with the summer and
winter solstice sunsets.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Like Meso-Indians, some Poverty Point Indians lived in small dispersed
groups, but others established regional centers where large populations
lived throughout the year. Oval or horseshoe-shaped structures of
earth or shell were usually built at these centers. The reason for the
construction is unknown, but it is likely that the Poverty Point leaders
lived at such sites and that the sites functioned as ceremonial, political and
trading centers.</p>
<p>The Poverty Point Site in northeastern Louisiana was the largest
regional center. It was built between the Mississippi and the Arkansas
rivers. Using these rivers, as well as land routes, Poverty Point Indians
traded with other Indians as far away as Illinois, Virginia and Florida.</p>
<p>At the Poverty Point Site, the Indians built earthen ridges that form
six semicircles, one inside the other. The ridges are interrupted by four
aisles that radiate out from the inner area. The outer ridge of these
earthworks measures nearly three-quarters of a mile across. Immediately
to the west is an earthen mound 70 feet high and just north of it is another
mound, 21 feet high.</p>
<p>The ridges and mounds were built by hand. Workers loosened dirt
with shells or stones used like hoes, then filled baskets and animal hides
with soil and carried them to the construction area. It took approximately
30 million 50-pound loads to build the earthen ridges and the two large
mounds at Poverty Point. The construction must have taken many generations
to complete.</p>
<p>Poverty Point Indians probably had a ruling class, perhaps with a
chief, to direct earthwork construction and long-distance trade. The leadership
also may have helped organize food collecting and hunting activities.</p>
<p>People living at the regional center relied on hunting, fishing, and
plant collecting to supply their food, just as Meso-Indians had. They may
also have sown seeds of favorite wild plants in cleared garden areas. There
are indications that the Poverty Point Indians grew pigweed, marsh elder,
knotweed, lamb&rsquo;s quarters and sunflowers using this cultivation technique.
This gardening, though helpful, would not have been essential to
feed the people in the rich natural environments where they lived.</p>
<p>Poverty Point Indians continued to use the tools that Meso-Indians
had used for hunting, collecting, and food preparation. They were likely,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
however, to get some of the stone for these tools through long-distance
trade. The Neo-Indians also made new tools that were added to the
Meso-Indian ones.</p>
<p>They made oval-shaped stone plummets that were used as weights on
bolas or nets. A bola could be flung so that it wrapped around the feet of
wild game. Weighted nets could have trapped both fish and small game.
Stone for the plummets used by Louisiana Indians was magnetite and
hematite from Missouri and northern Arkansas.</p>
<p>The Poverty Point Indians cooked their food in a new way. They
made clay cooking balls that probably were used like charcoal briquettes
for roasting and baking. They rolled clay in their hands, then squeezed or
shaped it into one of many forms. These were dried and heated in a fire
until hot, then up to 200 were placed in a roasting pit. The different shapes
may simply indicate the maker&rsquo;s design preference or may have controlled
temperature and cooking time.</p>
<p>Another change in food preparation was the introduction of stone, and
later, pottery vessels. The stone cooking or storage bowls were made from
steatite (soapstone), or less commonly from sandstone. Later in the
period, the first Louisiana pottery vessels were made, and these probably
were modeled after the earlier stone bowls.</p>
<p>In addition to these practical goods, Indians of this period made many
exotic ornamental objects including stone and clay figurines, beads, and
pendants. The figurines were about 2.5 inches tall and represented seated
females, but usually the heads were removed. This may indicate that the
clay figurines were used in some kind of ceremony. The beads were made
from copper and clay, as well as gems and other stones. Pendants, also
made from clay and stone, were in the shape of birds, insects, miniature
tools, and geometrical shapes.</p>
<p>The Indians may have cut and drilled stones to make pendants and
beads with small stone tools usually less than an inch in length. These
tools, called microtools, were also used for cutting, scraping, sawing and
engraving bone, antler, and wood.</p>
<p>Many distinctive traits of the Poverty Point Culture were shared by
people living in Mexico and Central America at that time and even earlier.
These traits included earthwork construction, planned villages, clay
figurines, stone beads and pendants, and microtools. These southern Indians
almost certainly influenced the development of certain aspects of
Poverty Point culture, either by direct contact or by descriptions shared
by travelers.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The Poverty Point Culture that flourished for over 1,000 years had
virtually disappeared by 500 B.C. There is no evidence of warfare or
conflict with another group, so perhaps internal political or religious
changes caused the decline. In any event, people gradually abandoned the
regional centers and returned to living in small scattered settlements.
Never again in Louisiana did the Indian people build such massive earthworks
or trade over such an extensive area.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Tchefuncte</h3>
<p>The simplified lifestyle that developed at the end of the Poverty Point
Period continued throughout the next cultural period. During the time of
the Tchefuncte (pronounced Che-funk&prime;tuh) Culture, from 500 B.C. until
A.D. 200, people lived in small scattered settlements. Long distance trade
was much less important, yet people in Louisiana were in contact with
people in western Mississippi, coastal Alabama, eastern Texas, Arkansas,
and southeastern Missouri.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, most Tchefuncte people seem to have lived in coastal
areas and in lowlands near slow-moving streams. In these areas, they
camped on natural levees, terraces, salt domes, cheniers and ridges that
provided dry ground in this wet environment. Here they built their
houses, probably temporary circular shelters having a frame of light poles
covered with thatch or grass mixed with mud.</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" />
<p class="pcap">Tchefuncte Site</p>
</div>
<p>The Tchefuncte Site, on the north
shore of Lake Pontchartrain, was so named
because it was situated inside Tchefuncte
State Park (renamed Fountainebleau State
Park). The site had two shell middens, one
that measured 100 feet by 250 feet and another
100 feet by 150 feet. Both were excavated,
and archaeologists found 50,000
pieces of pottery, as well as artifacts made
from bone, shell and stone. Forty-three
human burials were recovered, none of
which had objects buried with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>

<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="Building a circular shelter" width="500" height="700" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>They continued to depend on wild game and collected plant foods. In
the coastal areas, they ate tens of thousands of brackish water clams and
oysters, leaving behind piles of shells called shell middens. Because of the
number of shells, it once was thought that clams provided the major
protein source for Tchefuncte people. However, clam meat is actually low
in protein and also in other nutrients and calories. Clams were probably
eaten because they were always available, but they were not very important
in nourishing the people. Surprisingly, Tchefuncte people apparently
never ate crabs or crawfish, which also were plentiful.</p>
<p>Tchefuncte Indians obtained most of their protein from deer, raccoons,
alligators, and fish, but many other animals, especially small animals
and migratory birds were also eaten. The Indians used atlatls to kill
large game like deer and bear. For smaller mammals and birds, they
preferred traps, nets and bolas. They probably had several techniques for
fishing including netting, spearing, and fishing with hook and line. Like
the Meso-Indians before them, they gathered plant foods, including
grapes, plums, persimmons, acorns, and hickory nuts. They also grew
squash and gourds in small gardens.</p>
<p>Tchefuncte people were the first Indians in Louisiana to make large
amounts of pottery. They rolled coils of clay into shape and then smoothed
them to form a container. Many shapes of pots were made, but characteristically
they had &ldquo;footed&rdquo; bases. The Indians often decorated the vessels
by pressing fingernails, twigs or tools into the surface or by rocking a
small tool across the wet clay. After decorating the pots, they fired them
by slow baking.</p>
<p>Later Indians almost always kneaded the clay thoroughly and mixed
it with a small amount of another substance, called temper. These two
steps strengthened the clay and helped prevent it from shrinking unevenly
and cracking. Tchefuncte potters often omitted these steps,
perhaps because they were unaware of their importance, or perhaps because
clay was available and they could easily make another vessel if one
cracked.</p>
<p>The introduction of pottery was an important improvement in food
storage. When these pots were kept covered, they provided a relatively
dry and animal-proof container that was portable. This made it easier to
store food in times of plenty for use in leaner times. The Tchefuncte pots
also meant that stewing and other new cooking techniques could be experimented
with and developed for the first time.</p>

</div>
<p>Most of the other utensils and tools that Tchefuncte Indians used
were very similar to those that Poverty Point Indians made. These included
smoking pipes; stone, bone, and antler spear points; ground stone
atlatl weights; mortars; bone fishhooks; clay cooking balls; and other
butchering, hideworking, and woodworking tools.</p>
<p>In contrast to Poverty Point Indians, the Tchefuncte Indians did not
specialize in making stone beads, pendants, or microtools, and they did not
usually import materials to make tools and ornaments. Although some
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
innovations from the Poverty Point Culture were carried over, most
Tchefuncte tools and most Tchefuncte settlement patterns resemble those
of the Meso-Indians.</p>
<p>The majority of the information about this era comes from coastal
regions of the state. Archaeologists are not sure how Indians in the rest of
Louisiana were living at this same time, but it is likely that their culture
somewhat resembled that of the Tchefuncte Indians.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Marksville</h3>
<p>Sometime after 200 B.C., Indians of the highly influential Hopewell
Culture, centered in Ohio and Illinois, sent representatives throughout
the eastern United States. By at least the first century A.D., groups of
Louisiana Indians had met these travelers and had learned about their
culture. Hopewell people had powerful leaders who supervised a cult centered
around lavish burial rituals. Leaders organized construction of large
mounds in which certain high-status people were buried along with exquisitely
crafted objects made of copper, stone, bone, shell, pottery, and rare
minerals.</p>
<p>The Hopewell representatives may have been sent south in search of
a valued raw material or may have been sent as &ldquo;evangelists&rdquo; whose
mission it was to explain the virtues of Hopewell ceremonial life. Intentionally
or not, they introduced some Louisiana Indians to Hopewell practices.
The Louisiana manifestation of Hopewell life is called the Marksville
Culture.</p>
<div class="box">

<p class="pcap">Marksville Site</p>
</div>
<p>The Marksville Site, in Avoyelles Parish,
was the first scientifically excavated
site of the Marksville Culture. Burial
mounds at the site are encompassed by a
horseshoe-shaped earthen embankment
almost 3,000 feet long. The site is now a
State Commemorative Area open to the
public. A museum at the park houses an
exhibit describing the site and the people
who lived there.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Indians of the Marksville Culture began living in larger, more permanent
settlements, building burial mounds, and making Hopewell-styled
pottery, pipes, and ornaments. They most likely had leaders who directed
craftsmen, organized community life, and officiated at burial ceremonies.</p>
<p>Burial rituals must have been a very important part of the Marksville
Culture. Large mounds were constructed in several stages over many
years. The first stage usually was a flat low platform approximately three
feet high and 40 feet in diameter. Burial ceremonies were held months or
perhaps years apart and those who had died between ceremonies were
buried together. Some remains had been temporarily interred in other
areas, so these were reburied along with primary burials, and even cremations.</p>
<p>A pit was dug into the mound surface, and sometimes lined with logs
and matting. Human remains were placed in the pit with pottery, pipes,
stone points, shells, asphaltum, quartz crystals, and other valuable objects.
The bodies might be ornamented with jewelry such as copper beads,
earspools, bracelets, and necklaces of shell, pearls, or stone. Occasionally,
a dog was placed in the grave. The pit was filled with dirt. Later, other
pits might be dug for another occasion or burials might be made by placing
remains on the mound surface and covering them with a layer of earth.
Eventually, more construction increased the overall size of the mound and
shaped it into a dome.</p>
<p>The people buried in the mounds may have been high status individuals
who lived in villages near the mounds, while ordinary people lived in
scattered villages away from the ceremonial centers. Marksville Indians in
the coastal areas lived far from the elaborate burial mounds, but they still
practiced new styles of making pottery and other objects.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">

<p class="pcap">(&frac14; actual size)</p>
</div>
<p>The new Marksville pottery was made
from local clay, but it was quite similar in
shape and decoration to pottery of the
Hopewell Culture in Illinois and Ohio. A typical
Hopewell vessel would be a bowl three to
six inches tall. The rim would have cross-hatched
lines on the exterior at the top and the
design on the rest of the pot would be outlined
with bold lines cut in the clay. Quite often the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
designs were geometric shapes and stylized birds. The background would
be textured by rocking or stamping a small, toothed tool across the wet
clay. These decorated pots were made primarily for ceremonial uses.</p>
<p>The Marksville people also made other Hopewell-like objects including
copper and stone jewelry, platform pipes and figurines. The pipes had
relatively broad flat bases (platforms) approximately three inches long. At
one end was a hole for a wooden or reed pipe stem and in the center was a
bowl. Sometimes an animal figure was on the platform, with the bowl
formed in the animal&rsquo;s back. Animal and human figurines were also made.
Most of these Hopewell-like objects were buried in mounds as religious or
burial offerings.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>In contrast, Marksville people made most of their utilitarian objects
the same way as Tchefuncte people before them. Marksville people hunted
with atlatls, bolas and nets, and fished with hooks and line. They gathered
wild plants and shellfish, and probably grew a few domesticated plants in
small gardens. They stored food in pots and baskets, and cooked in pots.</p>
<p>It seems that despite the Hopewellian influence, much of the culture
was unaffected by contact with the northerners. Through time, Hopewellian
influence diminished. Louisiana Indians built fewer burial mounds,
developed their own distinctive pottery, and began a new way of hunting.</p>

<h3 id="c10">Troyville-Coles Creek</h3>
<p>The Troyville-Coles Creek Period lasted from approximately A.D.
400 to A.D. 1100. By the beginning of this period, influence from the
Ohio-Illinois Hopewell people had ceased, and pottery styles, mound
building, and ceremonial life had gradually changed.</p>
<p>The Troyville-Coles Creek people continued building ceremonial centers
with mounds, but these mounds differed from earlier ones. They were
larger, shaped differently, and more numerous. They also served a new
purpose. Instead of being primarily for burials, these mounds were constructed
to support temples or civic buildings. Pyramidal mounds with flat
tops, and sometimes with stepped ramps leading up one side, came into
style. They were constructed over hundreds of years, and usually were
enlarged one or more times. Although the total height might reach only 20
feet, the base might eventually be enlarged to more than 200 feet on each
side. At certain sites, three to nine mounds eventually were built, all
around an open, central plaza.</p>
<p>A temple and one or more other buildings were usually built on a
mound summit. These buildings were either circular or rectangular with
walls of wattle and daub. Wattle is a construction technique whereby
branches, twigs, cane, or vines are interlaced around upright posts that
have been sunk in the ground. These are then plastered with mud or clay
daub. The Troyville-Coles Creek people probably used grass thatch or
palmetto fronds for the roof.</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="277" />
<p class="pcap">Greenhouse Site</p>
</div>
<p>The Greenhouse Site, in Avoyelles
Parish, is the most extensively excavated
site that is typical of the Troyville-Coles
Creek Period. Seven earthen mounds there
surround an open plaza that measures 200
feet by 350 feet. No village or campsite remains
were found in the plaza or outside
the mound area. This leads archaeologists
to conclude that the mound group was used
for ceremonial activities only, and that
villagers lived elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Some people were buried in the mounds, but in contrast to Marksville
burials, the bodies were not accompanied by a rich assortment of objects.
One or more bodies were buried in pits, or simply laid upon the mound
summit and covered with dirt. People were also buried in village areas
away from the mounds. Why some were buried in the mounds and some
were not, remains a mystery. It may be that people associated with
mound construction, with temple activities, or those of significant social
status were buried in the mounds. Alternatively, if many people died from
illness, famine, or disaster, that might have signaled a time for special
ceremonies and mound enlargement. Those victims might have been
buried in a mound.</p>
<p>Villages and campsites were often a mile or more from these ceremonial
centers. There, daily life was more focused on maintaining a stable
food supply than on ceremonial activities. During the Troyville-Coles
Creek Period, important changes in hunting techniques and garden crops
helped guarantee this food supply.</p>
<p>It was during this period that the bow and
arrow came into use in Louisiana. First invented in
Europe thousands of years before, bows and arrows
were gradually adopted by people in Asia and eventually
by people in North America. The introduction
of the bow and arrow meant hunters could shoot
further, more accurately, and with more firepower
than before. The arrow points were generally
smaller than those used on spears. These then,
were the first true arrowheads made in Louisiana.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="264" />
<p class="pcap">(&frac34; actual size)</p>
</div>
<p>Troyville-Coles Creek people also continued using the atlatl, as well
as the traditional butchering and hideworking tools that had been made
since Meso-Indian times. There was no dramatic change in the types of
animals hunted during this time. The Indians killed game such as deer,
bear, small mammals, and game birds. They also ate fish and mollusks as
had their ancestors.</p>
<p>The Troyville-Coles Creek people continued collecting wild seeds,
fruits, roots, and other plant foods. They cultivated squash, gourds, and
native plants such as sunflowers and lamb&rsquo;s quarters, but a most important
addition to these garden crops was corn, which had been domesticated
earlier in Mexico. The Indians no doubt experimented with it for
many generations, developing strains and cultivation techniques best
suited to Louisiana conditions. Certain plant foods were still ground with
mealing stones and probably stored in pottery vessels.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>In this period, pottery styles changed, producing more durable pots
with more diversified uses. The Troyville-Coles Creek Indians tempered
their clay with particles of dried clay before coiling it to shape the pot.
They specialized in rounded or barrel-shaped jars and in deep or shallow
bowls. The potters removed coil marks by patting the surface with a
smooth wooden paddle.</p>
<p>Sometimes they used a carved wooden paddle to stamp designs onto
the entire outer surface of the vessel. At other times they decorated only
the top half of the pot with designs formed by incising lines or pressing
tools into the damp clay. The colors of the clay were usually tan, brown,
gray or black. On rare occasions vessels were colored red on the outside or
shaped into human effigies.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Late in the Troyville-Coles Creek Period, changes began to occur.
Indians in the northwestern part of the state developed close ties with
people living north and west of them, while those in the east became more
closely aligned with people to their east. Descendants of the Troyville-Coles
Creek people were Indians of the Caddo and of the Plaquemine-Mississipian
cultures.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Caddo</h3>
<p>By about A.D. 800, descendants of the Troyville-Coles Creek people
living in northwestern Louisiana had developed close ties with people in
southeastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas and southern Arkansas.
From this region emerged the Caddo Culture. These Indians developed a
fine, new style of pottery, and used special ornaments and objects made
from imported materials. They also performed elaborate burials of upper
class people.</p>
<p>There was little change in the daily life of the ordinary Indians. Most
people spent their lives in small villages and hamlets near streams or
lakes. Many trends established in earlier generations persisted. New garden
crops such as beans were introduced and were added to the corn,
squash, gourds and native plants already grown. It seems that people
from these small settlements were governed by high status individuals
living at the ceremonial centers. Common people were probably required
to help build mounds, to supply food, or to make tools or special objects for
their rulers. They gathered at the centers when they were needed or
when special ceremonies or festivals were celebrated.</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" />
<p class="pcap">Gahagan Site</p>
</div>
<p>At the Gahagan Site, in Red River
Parish, early Caddo Indians built mounds
and a village around a large open plaza. One
mound had three deep shaft burials, each
with three to six bodies and 200 to 400 burial
offerings. Some of the unusual burial objects
from this site are two clay human effigy
pipes, two copper cutouts of human
hands, two copper long-nosed mask ear ornaments,
two frog effigy pipes, and numerous
triangular stone blades called &ldquo;Gahagan
knives.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Early Caddo people continued the Troyville-Coles Creek custom of
constructing ceremonial centers with mounds around a central plaza. They
built temples or special buildings on top of the mounds and also dug graves
into the mounds for burials of important people.</p>
<p>These mound burials, however, differed somewhat from those of earlier
cultures. To bury an honored priest or chief, Caddo people dug a large
deep shaft, often all the way from the top of the mound to the ground
level. Then they placed the chief&rsquo;s body, and other bodies (possibly of
sacrificed servants or family members) in the grave side by side. Special
objects were piled in the corner or along the wall of the pit.</p>
<p>Burial offerings included well-made tools, ceremonial objects and
jewelry designated only for high status people. Typical objects were fine
pottery, carefully flaked stone knives, arrow points, bows, turtle shell
rattles, polished stone axes, rare minerals, stone or clay smoking pipes,
animal teeth pendants, bone hairpins, ear ornaments of bone, shell, or
copper, and beads of copper, shell, and stone. Unusual objects were pipes
in the form of humans and frogs, sheets of copper cut in the shape of
hands, and ear ornaments resembling small copper masks. The face of
each &ldquo;mask&rdquo; was an oval about three inches long, but the nose was seven
inches long. Interestingly, at the same time, identical masks were also
used by Indians as far away as Missouri, Wisconsin and Florida.</p>
<p>Caddo potters made special new shapes such as bottles, and bowls
with sharply angled rims. They fired the pieces in a new way so they
would be black or dark mahogany in color, then polished the dark surfaces
to make them glossy. Some common ornamental designs were curved lines
cut into the surface and sometimes highlighted with red or green-colored
pigment rubbed into the engraved lines. Not surprisingly, much of the
utilitarian pottery remained quite similar in appearance to the late
Troyville-Coles Creek pottery. Caddo Indians probably still used it for
daily chores, while they saved more ornate wares for special occasions.</p>
<p>The ordinary Caddo Culture people lived in villages away from the
mound center. Their lives were centered around hunting, fishing, collecting,
and gardening activities. When a commoner died, he or she was
buried in a simple grave without objects. Although this way of life seems
totally separate from the elaborate life of the elite, the two worlds overlapped
at ceremonial occasions, when everyone gathered at the mound
centers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1400, Caddo ceremonial life seems to
have been less important. All burials were simple, with only one person in
a grave. Fewer imported stones and minerals were used to make high
status objects, and more ordinary pottery was made.</p>
<p>After A.D. 1400, there was a return to Caddo ceremonialism. Many
early Caddo customs were revived, but new practices were also added.
Mound construction resumed, with temples, lodges, or chiefs&rsquo; houses
being built on top. These structures characteristically were built of wattle
and daub and had thatched roofs. They were used for a time, then they
were burned, probably when the leader or an important person died.
Workers covered the ruins with sand or clay, and eventually replaced the
old building with a new one. Sometimes graves were dug through the floor
of standing buildings or through the rubble of burned ones. As many as
seven people have been found buried together in these graves, along with
food offerings and large numbers of objects.</p>
<p>As in earlier times, important people had special customs and belongings
that ordinary people did not have. One custom was that of binding an
infant&rsquo;s head to a cradleboard so that as the person grew to maturity the
head was noticeably flattened and therefore distinguished the high class
person from people of the lower class. Upper class people used ornate clay
pipes, conch shell cups, ceremonial objects, fine pottery, and jewelry.
Their jewelry included anklets, necklaces, bone hairpins, and bone pottery
and shell discs that were worn through the ears. Some pendants were
fashioned from mammal teeth or shells, and occasionally a large sea shell
pendant had a lizard or salamander engraved on it.</p>
<p>Caddo leaders of this late period probably used the most delicate and
decorated pottery. Pots ranged in size from miniatures to large wide-mouthed
storage vessels. Many shapes were made, but special vessels
were formed to resemble birds and turtles, or to act as rattles. Popular
designs were circles, scrolls, and crosses engraved into the vessel after
firing. Engraved designs were often highlighted with red, white or green
pigments.</p>
<p>Daily life of ordinary people was much different than that of the elite.
As far as we know, the former continued to live as they had during the
earlier part of the period. They lived in circular houses in small villages
located near their gardens and buried their dead in simple graves with few
goods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>By the time the first Europeans reached Caddo villages in the mid-1500s,
Caddo Indians were divided into several distinct groups. In Louisiana,
these were the Adaes, Doustioni, Natchitoches, Ouachita and Yatasi.
The Indians supplied the Europeans with salt, horses, and food in exchange
for glass beads, kettles, guns, ammunition, knives, ceramics, bells
and bracelets. Contact with the Spanish and French explorers ended the
prehistoric era, and led to rapid and devastating changes in the traditional
life.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Plaquemine-Mississippian</h3>
<p>While Caddo Indians flourished in northwestern Louisiana, those in
the rest of the state by approximately A.D. 1000 had a slightly different
way of life. Many of the latter were part of the Plaquemine Culture, who
like the Caddo, were descendants of Troyville-Coles Creek Indians. In
keeping with the patterns established by their ancestors, Plaquemine
people built large ceremonial centers with two or more large mounds
facing an open plaza. The flat-topped, pyramidal mounds were constructed
in several stages, and eventually measured more than 100 feet on a side
and 10 feet high. Sometimes they were topped by one or two smaller
mounds.</p>
<div class="box">
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" />
<p class="pcap">Medora Site</p>
</div>
<p>The Plaquemine Culture was so named
because the Medora Site, typical of the
period, is near Plaquemine, Louisiana, in
West Baton Rouge Parish. The site had
two mounds approximately 400 feet apart
with a plaza in between. One was a flat-topped
pyramid 125 feet on a side 13 feet
high with a small domed mound three feet
high and 25 feet in diameter on top. The
other one was two feet high and 100 feet in
diameter. Eighteen thousand pieces of broken
pottery were found at Medora, along
with a few stone tools.</p>
</div>
<p>Plaquemine Indians often built the mounds on top of the ruins of a
house or temple, and constructed similar buildings on top of the mound. In
earlier times, buildings were usually circular, but later they were likely to
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
be rectangular. They were constructed with wattle and daub, and sometimes
with wall posts sunk into foot-deep wall trenches.</p>
<p>At times, the Indians dug shallow, oval or rectangular graves in the
mounds. These might be for primary burials of individuals, but more
frequently they were for the reburial of remains originally interred
elsewhere. Some graves contained only skulls, and one of these had 66
skulls. Burial offerings included pottery, pipes, stone points, and axes
made of ground stone.</p>
<p>One type of pottery occasionally placed
in the graves is called &ldquo;killed&rdquo; pottery. This
type has a hole in the base of the vessel that
was cut while the pot was being made, usually
before it was fired. The Plaquemine Indians
also decorated their pots in other
characteristic ways. They sometimes added
small solid handles called lugs, and textured
the surface by brushing clumps of grass over
the vessel before it was fired. They often cut
designs into the surface of the wet clay, and
like their Caddo contemporaries, the Plaquemine
Indians engraved designs on pots after
they were fired. Plaquemine Indians also had
undecorated pots which they used for ordinary
daily tasks.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="395" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">(&#8531; actual size)</p>
</div>
<p>Not surprisingly, the ordinary people lived much as the average
Caddo Indians. They participated in festivals and ceremonies at the
mound centers, but spent most of their time with families and neighbors
collecting and producing food, or participating in village activities.</p>
<p>During the early part of the period some hunters still used atlatls, but
soon bows and arrows predominated. The Indians hunted deer, bear,
rabbit, squirrel, raccoon, turkey and duck; fished for gar and drum; and
collected mussels. Although the Plaquemine Indians tended gardens of
corn, squash, pumpkins and beans, they still collected many wild seeds,
roots, nuts and fruits.</p>
<p>At approximately the same time as Caddo and Plaquemine Indians
were living in Louisiana, Mississippian Culture people in the St. Louis
area had developed the largest prehistoric center in the United States.
This was a ceremonial, residential, and trading center with a population of
35,000-40,000 people. The Mississippian Culture spread throughout the
southeastern United States, and was characterized by huge earthen temple
mounds, widespread trading networks, and a ceremonial complex represented
by elaborately shaped pottery and stone, bone, shell and copper
objects.</p>

</div>
<p>As far as we know, no major Mississippian centers developed in Louisiana,
although ones were established in Georgia at Etowah and in
Alabama at Moundville. There is evidence that sometime between A.D.
1000 and A.D. 1600 small groups of people from the eastern Mississippian
centers made their way to Louisiana. They came to the Avery Island area
to collect and refine salt, and to other parts of the state to search for other
materials. Perhaps through repeated contacts, a few groups of Louisiana
Indians learned classic Mississippian techniques of making pottery and
other ceremonial objects. Some Indians in the southeastern and northeastern
parts of Louisiana may even have established close ties with their
eastern neighbors and added Mississippian customs to the Plaquemine
Culture. Louisiana groups that may have descended from those Mississippian
groups are those who speak the Tunican, Chitimachan, and Muskogean
languages. Those who probably descended from Plaquemine Culture
Indians are the Taensa and Natchez.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">EUROPEAN TRAVELERS DESCRIBE INDIANS</span></h2>
<p>Early European descriptions of the Natchez and Taensa Indians help
us understand their life, and give an idea of the way many of the late
prehistoric Indians throughout Louisiana lived. European travelers reported
that some Indians lived near the ceremonial centers that had
mounds surrounding a central plaza. The two most important buildings,
the temple and the chief&rsquo;s house, were at the center.</p>
<p>The temple was on the summit of one of the mounds, or was in a
prominent place facing the plaza. It had thick wattle and daub walls and a
thatched roof with carved and painted wooden animal effigies on top.
Inside, a sacred fire was tended by several Indians, whose job it was to
keep the fire always burning. Bones of past chiefs, and servants who had
died with them, were stored in baskets or on a low clay altar. Also, valued
objects such as clay figurines, crystals, and carved wooden objects were
kept in the temple.</p>
<p>The temple faced a plaza that was the scene of community feasts and
rituals, as well as games, such as chunkey. In chunkey, opponents hurled
long poles after a rolling disc. The one whose pole landed closest to the
place where the disc stopped rolling won a point, or valued possessions, if
bets had been made.</p>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s house, situated on top of a mound, overlooked the plaza
area. The chief used the house as his living quarters as well as a reception
area for visitors and subjects. The furnishings of the house included
wooden beds covered with matting, and perhaps a wooden stump used as a
stool. Reed or cane torches provided light. Servants waited on the chief,
always keeping a respectful distance, and quickly meeting all of his needs.
No one ever used the chief&rsquo;s belongings or walked in front of him.</p>
<p>The chief was a highly honored and respected person, and his death
was a time for great mourning. Ceremonies, dancing, and processions
were part of the burial rituals that continued for several days. The chief&rsquo;s
wife, servants, and others who volunteered for the honor, were sedated
and ritually strangled as part of the ceremonies. The bodies were placed
on special raised tombs covered with branches and mud. After many
weeks, the bones were removed and placed in baskets that were stored in
the temple. Eventually, the bones were buried in a platform in the temple,
or were buried in the mound when it was expanded. The deceased chief&rsquo;s
house was usually burned and might be covered with another layer of
earth before the new chief&rsquo;s house was built. The son of the dead chief&rsquo;s
sister would become the next ruler.</p>

<p>People from miles around came to participate in the burial ceremonies,
after which they returned to their villages and resumed their
normal lives. Some lived in small communities near the mounds, but
others lived in scattered settlements miles away.</p>
<p>Their clothing was very simple. The men wore only a cloth or
deerskin breechcloth, unless the weather was cold. Then they added long
deerskin shirts and leggings. Women wore skirts of skin or of cloth woven
from tree bark, and in cold weather they also wore a skin wrap.</p>
<p>Women usually wore their hair long, sometimes tying it back, or
braiding it. Men wore theirs short, and in many styles. Sometimes they
even completely removed the hair from one side of their head. Women
often decorated themselves by blackening their teeth with ashes and by
rubbing red pigment on their faces, shoulders, and stomachs. Men decorated
themselves, too, especially on ceremonial occasions when they
painted themselves with red, white or black markings and tied feathers in
their hair. Both men and women wore earrings in their pierced ears and
large pendants or strings of shells or seeds around their neck. Honored
warriors and upper class people wore red and black tattoos on their faces
and other parts of their bodies.</p>
<p>The men and women had very different daily tasks. Women took care
of the young children; planted, tended and harvested the crops; cooked the
meals; and made the pottery, baskets, mats and clothing. Men&rsquo;s work
consisted of housebuilding, canoe-making, and clearing land for gardens,
along with defense, hunting, woodcutting, and making the tools for these
chores. The men also had primary responsibilities for ritual and political
activities.</p>
<p>The European explorers traded with the men. Europeans provided
guns, ammunition, metal kettles, iron tools, glass beads, and metal ornaments.
These were sometimes given as gifts to hosts, guides, or to the
chief and they were also exchanged for pearls or baskets, and for necessities
such as meat, oil, salt, skins and horses.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">ARCHAEOLOGY AND LOUISIANA&rsquo;S PAST</span></h2>
<p>Upon the arrival of Europeans in Louisiana and their written descriptions
of the Indians, the prehistoric period came to an end. However, our
understanding of this prehistory is still incomplete. Hundreds of major
questions remain, including very basic ones: When did the first Indians
reach Louisiana? What sparked the development of the Poverty Point
Culture? Where and how were the Mexican plants of corn, beans and
squash introduced to Louisiana? Which prehistoric groups were the ancestors
of each of Louisiana&rsquo;s historic Indian tribes? The answers to these and
many other questions remain buried in archaeological sites throughout the
state. If enough sites can be studied before they are destroyed, there is
hope that the story of the state&rsquo;s prehistory can be better explained.</p>
<p>The importance of archaeology in understanding Louisiana&rsquo;s past
does not stop with the end of the prehistoric era. Historic archaeologists
also study Indian sites that date after the contact with Europeans. In this
way, archaeologists can document the many dramatic changes in Indian
culture during historic times. Archaeologists also excavate sites associated
with African-American and European-American life in Louisiana.
These archaeological investigations supplement, and often correct, the
written documents that describe the state&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>With the cooperation and participation of Louisiana&rsquo;s citizens, the
archaeological study of our state will continue. Through the protection of
sites and the funding of scientific excavations, we can discover more about
the past. Then the story of Louisiana&rsquo;s prehistory and early historic development
can be retold, more accurately and more completely.</p>
